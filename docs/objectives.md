## üîç Admin Panel Overview

The Admin Panel for the Bus Tracking System serves as the central management hub for administrators to oversee all aspects of the transportation operation. This includes managing users, buses, routes, handling reports, analyzing system data, and configuring system-wide settings. The panel provides comprehensive tools that enable efficient management, data-driven decision making, and streamlined administrative workflows.
